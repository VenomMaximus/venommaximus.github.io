title: 'KaiserreduX - Assorted'
---
I have worked on [KaiserreduX](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2076426030) for at least four years now, predominantly as a scripter, writer, tester, and developer. While I am certainly most known for the **German Rework**, the main project on my portfolio here, I have also done a lot of other assorted things for the mod throughout my years of labor!

First, however, I must explain a few terms I will use.

A "tree" refers to a "focus tree", and in the context of Hearts of Iron IV this is functionally a set of directives that a nation undertakes, such as industrialization of a specific region, reforming the nation's army, or performing political actions. A "focus tree" is thus what a nation in Hearts of Iron IV is able to do, and these trees tend to have specific choices or routes, or require specific objectives to be performed in the game to be able to be done (such as building enough ships to complete a naval reform focus).

Throughout my time in KaiserreduX, I have predominantly enjoyed working on the mechanical side of things, with a great deal of my additions to the mod including reworks to a nation's military or economy. These parts of the game are heavily interacted with by the player, and so they are due just as much attention as the political or diplomatic parts of Hearts of Iron IV.

## American Union State Military Tree

This is definitively shown through my rework of the military tree for the American Union State. The AUS is a major player in the Second American Civil War in the mod, and due to them being a nation primarily played for this war-related experience I found it imperative that their military content be flavorful, powerful, and above all fun to go through. I had given the player four different types of doctrine to use, and flavored these doctrines around four important figures in the player's nation.

I worked to ensure this content was relevant for the real-life historical figures I was using, such as it was with me ensuring Marine Corps general "Chesty" Puller's content related to the history of the USMC, and I also decided to shed light on lesser-known parts of relevant American history, such as the military's usage of Native American "code talkers" to increase their encryption over military communications.

I had additionally made military trees for New England, a state propped up by the Kingdom of Canada during the Second American Civil War, and the Black Belt Republic, an African-American state formed to end their oppression at the hands of the Constitutional American Republic.

## Götterdämmerung Update

Mods like KaiserreduX must update alongside the base game's own updates, such as it was when Hearts of Iron IV had the [No Step Back](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1348661/Expansion__Hearts_of_Iron_IV_No_Step_Back/) update in November 2021. When the [Götterdämmerung](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152780/Expansion__Hearts_of_Iron_IV_Gtterdmmerung/) DLC was released, many new features were added to the base game as well as with the DLC itself, such as special projects, research facilities, scientists, and an overhaul to missiles.

I ensured that KaiserreduX was updated for this major update within *two days* of the update's release to the public. This kept the mod's fans from waiting too long to be able to play KaiserreduX with the update's new content. I had worked on adding the new units, technologies, etc. to the mod so that players could enjoy them, and also kept the mod from having bugs or glitches as a result of this new update.
